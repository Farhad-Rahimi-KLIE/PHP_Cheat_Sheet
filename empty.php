Empty is Used to Check whether a variable is empty or not.
<?php
$var = 0;
// Evaluates to true because $var is empty 
if (empty($var)) {
echo '$var is either 0, empty, or not set at all';
}
// Evaluates as true because $var is set 
if (isset($var)) {
echo '$var is set even though it is empty';
}
?>
